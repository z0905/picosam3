# In-Sensor Centered Image Segmentation

### [📜 PicoSAM2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.18807)  | 📜 [PicoSAM3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2603.11917)

**PicoSAM2** and **PicoSAM3** are minimal, segmentation model distilled from Meta’s SAM 2.1 and SAM3 — purpose-built for deployment on edge devices such as the **Sony IMX500**. It replicates the implicit centered image segmentation while drastically reducing model size and computational cost, making real-time inference feasible on low-power hardware.

>  ~1.2MB quantized model  
>  Real-time inference on embedded devices  
>  Supports implicit point-based prompt segmentation  
>  Distilled from SAM2.1  Hiera Tiny and SAM3

## Quick Start

PicoSAM2 and PicoSAM3 come with an automated setup script `init.sh` to get everything ready in one step. It:

- Downloads **COCO 2017** validation and training images  
- Downloads **LVIS v1** validation annotations  
- Unzips and organizes all files under a structured `dataset/` folder  
- Downloads all **SAM 2.1** model checkpoints into `checkpoints/`   
- Installs all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`  
- Installs the project into the environment  


### To get started, simply run:

```bash
./init.sh
```
You do **not** need to manually download any datasets or checkpoints — everything is handled by the script.

Afterwards (optional if you just want to use the compression pipeline) download the pretrained PicoSAM2 weights from this [Zenodo folder](https://zenodo.org/records/15728470) and add them to the checkpoints directory.

## How to Use

Once the setup is complete, activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate sam3
```

Then you can run any script inside the `model_compression/` folder:

```bash 
python3 -m model_compression.picosam3.picosam3_model_distillation       # Distill student from SAM3
python3 -m model_compression.picosam3.picosam3_train_from_scratch       # Train supervised baseline
python3 -m model_compression.picosam3.benchmark                         # Evaluate mIoU, mAP 
python3 -m model_compression.picosam3.imx500_converter                  # Export ONNX for IMX500
```

## Deployment on the IMX500

From now on, follow the official deployment documentation of the raspberrypi AI Camera: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/ai-camera.html#model-deployment

The model converted to IMX500 format from the onnx (Can be done still on your computer): 
```bash
imxconv-pt -i picosam2_student_quantized.onnx -o . --overwrite-output
```
 Result is a PackerOut.zip which then should be loaded onto the raspberry pi.

 Afterwards, on the raspberrypi, run:
 ```bash
imx500-package -i packerOut.zip -o .
```
This creates a network.rpk file, which afterwards can be deployed on the IMX500 using the Picamera2 Script.

## Pretrained Checkpoints (Example PicoSam2)

After setup, the following files are available under `checkpoints/`:

| File                             | Description                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `PicoSAM2_student_epoch1.pt`     | Student model trained via distillation (Google Drive) |
| `PicoSAM2_student_quantized.onnx`| Quantized export ready for IMX500 conversion (Google Drive) |
| `PicoSAM2_epoch1.pt`             | Supervised baseline (Google Drive)                    |
| `sam2.1_hiera_*.pt`              | SAM 2.1 teacher models (Tiny → Large) |

These are ready for use in training, benchmarking, or deployment.
